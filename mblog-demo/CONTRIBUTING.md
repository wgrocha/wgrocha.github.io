### What do you need to know to help?

The mBlog is a very simple blog engine, it uses raw Javascript, CSS and HTML, the database is a simple JSON file. By the way, if you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! You can also contribute to documentation, translation or any other kind of contribution to improve mBlog.<br><br>
If you are interested in making a code contribution and would like to learn more about how mBlog really works check out the [documentation](#).

### How to make a contribution?

Have you ever made an open source contribution? Are you wondering how is the contribution workflow? Check it out!

- Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add;
- Fork the repository associated with the issue to your GitHub. This means that you will have your own copy of the repository;
- Clone the repository to your local machine using ```git clone https://github.com/wgrocha/mblog.git```;
- Create a new branch for your fix using ```git checkout -b branch-name-here```;
- Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add;
- Use ```git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here``` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index;
- Use ```git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"``` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message;
- Push the changes to the remote repository using ```git push origin branch-name-here```;
- Submit a pull request to the upstream repository;
- Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Fixed the javascript bug reported on #4352";
- In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have for the maintainer. It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it;
- Wait for the pull request to be reviewed;
- Make changes to the pull request if you are recommended to do so.
- Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
